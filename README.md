# SimpleCLI

This is a simple interface running in the commandline.
It is similar to what we will see on the exam for task 2-3.

To run:
1. Write make in the terminal window, while being in the project root folder.
2. Write ./oppgave1 in the same terminal window, while remaining in the project root folder.
3. Use the interface by typing values in the terminal and pressing the enter key to submit.
